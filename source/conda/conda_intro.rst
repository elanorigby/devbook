Should I use Conda instead?
===========================

I am checking out Conda to have one tool that 

1. manages python versions (instead of pyenv)
2. creates virtual environments (instead of vitualenv)

I'm using Miniconda because I do not need the vast array of mathy/sciency tools that Anaconda automatically installs for you. 

I am going to use conda to replace pyenv and virtualenv, but continue to use pip for all my package installs. This is for simplicity, and also so that I can continue to use my true dev loves, pipdeptree and pip-tools.
