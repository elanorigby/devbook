Should I use Conda instead?
===========================

I am trialling using Conda (via Miniconda) to have one tool that 

1. manages python versions (instead of pyenv)
2. creates virtual environments (instead of vitualenv)

I think I am going to use pip as usual within a conda env, rather than some mix of conda and pip as package managers.
This is for simplicity, and also so that I can continue to use my true dev loves, pipdeptree and pip-tools. 

tl:dr I am going to use conda to replace pyenv and virtualenv, but not pip.
