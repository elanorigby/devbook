A very nerdy diary 👩🏻‍💻
============================
You know how sometimes you spend a long time figuring something out and then by the time you need that knowledge again you've forgotten? This is an attempt to minimize that and, as such, is a continual work in progress. There are some parts that are like a guide, and I intend to keep them correct and updated, but if you're looking for an actual *guide*, `The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python <https://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is an *actual* guide.
If you see anything that's glaringly wrong, send me a pull request! That would be very nice.
