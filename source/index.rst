=================================

Greetings, Internaut.
This is a place to keep all the knowledge I gain that in \~the future\~ I'm going to need to do and be like "I spent so long figuring that junk out and looking stuff up and now I have to do it all over again I wish I had written it down" so that's what I'm doing. And a good way to remember stuff is to explain it, even if it's in a doc that no one reads. If you are reading this, though, in view of finding advice, allow me to disclaimer: I intend to keep this updated and correct as possible, but I make no promises. If you find something blaringly incorrect, or have suggestions for an update, pull request me! That would be very nice.
