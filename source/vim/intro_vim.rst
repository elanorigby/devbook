Vim: it make you feel leik a wizard
====================================

Learning it, tho.
------------------

#. Have enough people tell you it's awesome that you're like OK FINE
#. Watch some vids of people doing handy stuff with it
#. Once you're sure you've got vim on your compy, run ``vimtutor``
#. Go through vimtutor in bite-sized chunks, maybe 3 lessons at a time.
#. In between each chunk use what you've learned until you're pretty comfortable.
#. Struggle
#. Profit


Key Bindings, or Pressing Esc is Annoying
------------------------------------------

If your compy is old school enough to still have a physical escape key (ahahhahaha) then it'll be in a super annoying place. Mode switching is, like, important, and you're going to get real tired of diving up to the top of the keyboard every 0.57 seconds. Here's what I did about it:
(for MacOSX)

  
#. Install this thing called Karabiner Elements - https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html

#. Go to the "complex modifications" tab

#. Click "add rule"

#. Click the "Import more rules from the internet" button at the top

#. Peruse and choose your key remappings. I chose "Change caps_lock to control if pressed with other keys, to escape if pressed alone."

#. Profit  

Good keybindings are the ballbearings in the fidget spinner of your programming workflow.
